## Overview

Another simple landing I did to get the hang of grid layouts and implementing gallery using Swiper.

Design materials included 1440px, 768px and 375px resolution options, I made sure the result is pixel perfect for them and also adapts to all the other screen sizes.

BEM naming was used and some onscroll animation was added.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard
